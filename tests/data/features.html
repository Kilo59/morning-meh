    <ul>
        <li>These use Hybrid Electrostatz Technology</li>
        <li>What does that mean?</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.headphone.guru/verisonix-n501-electrostatic-headphone-review/">This review</a> might
            answer that question</li>
        <li>Or <a href="https://www.headfonia.com/review-verisonixs-n501/">this one</a></li>
        <li>Basically: it means they sound crisp as hell</li>
        <li>And they look pretty dope, right?</li>
        <li>If you’re like, how do <em>we</em> have these great headphones for so cheap, it’s sorta goofy: basically,
            Verisonix made these for a company called Mitchell and Johnson, but then Mitchell and Johnson ceased
            operations due to Brexit, leaving Verisonix with an excess, so we swooped in</li>
        <li>We mention all this because if your defacto (and, honestly, reasonable) reaction is to be skeptical of the
            quality of anything we sell because we’re the ones selling it, you should know that these are actually good
